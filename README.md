# Terrain-Generator
A program that generates a matrix of points, basing each new point off of neighboring points to generate something that might represent approximate ground height across the matrix.

Also a means for me to start learning rust.

### Build or Run:
* [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
* In a shell in the project directory, run `cargo run`.
